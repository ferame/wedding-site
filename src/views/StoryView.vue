              As you might know we both studied in Scotland - Elena in Glasgow and Justin in Edinburgh. Thus, we did not meet each other until 2018 when we both attended work training in London. A month later, while on a group trip to a rainy Scottish village, Elena’s umbrella broke and Justinas kindly offered to shelter her under his.
            </p>
            <p>We have been inseparable ever since this cute umbrella story. Umbrellas are also engraved on the wedding rings that we will exchange on 15th June. We are not expecting rain on the day but if it happens, we will happily welcome it.</p>
